# Hey Apple

## What it is
An app for creating & managing grocery lists from data exported from [FDDB](https://fddb.info).

FDDB is an online calorie tracker that does a lot of things well, but it lacks a convenient way of creating grocery
lists from the diary or any of the recipes. It allows exporting to CSV, though, which is what this app uses to
provie the missing functionality.

A shopping list is created from data exported in CSV format and stored in the cloud. Items from different days
are combined into one entry, showing the total amount needed for the selected time frame. Food can be associated
with store aisles and sorted by name or aisle.

## What it isn't
This app is not a full calorie & nutrient tracker and doesn't provide any tracking functionality on its own.
Given time, it might evolve in that direction. Don't quote me on that, though.

## Building the app
Place the app in the **nextcloud/apps/** directory.
